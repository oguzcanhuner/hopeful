# Angry Spec

This is a project which was massively inspired by one of Gary Bernhardt's earlier
screencasts on [DAS](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/building-rspec-from-scratch)

The idea is to recreate rspec from scratch to allow me (and whoever else) to use some of the
more advanced ruby language features. I'll be changing some of the syntax to make it more fun
(I'm thinking along the lines of "2.better be_true!" or "i_hope{2}.is true"), but apart from
that, it should hopefully be quite similar to rspec :).

More than anything, I want this to be a hub for people to practice on, so anyone is welcome
to contribute, no matter what your level of skill. 

If you have any questions you can email me at oguzcanhuner@gmail.com.

TODO:

- create descriptive exceptions
