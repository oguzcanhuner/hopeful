# Angry Spec

This is a project which was massively inspired by one of Gary Bernhardt's earlier
screencasts on [DAS](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/building-rspec-from-scratch)

The idea is to recreate rspec from scratch to allow me (and whoever else) to use some of the
more advanced ruby language features. I'll be changing some of the syntax to make it more fun,
but apart from that, it should hopefully be quite similar to rspec :).

More than anything, I want this to be a hub for people to practice on, so anyone is welcome
to contribute, no matter what your level of skill. 

If you have any questions you can email me at oguzcanhuner@gmail.com.

TODO:

- figure out how to create matchers which can be called without a dot. for example:

    something.should be_nil

- create descriptive exceptions
- implement more matchers
